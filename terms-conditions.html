    essential purpose.</p>
<p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or

    liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
<h2>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects without
    warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on
    behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all
    warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied
    warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may
    arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing,
    the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet
    Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications,
    systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or
    that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>

    free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory
    rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a
    case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable
    under applicable law.</p>
